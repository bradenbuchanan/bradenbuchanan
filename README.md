Hi, I'm Braden Buchanan ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a Senior Product Manager at Roche, based in Seattle, WA, with a background that bridges UX research, product strategy, and computer science. I care deeply about building products that meet real human needsâ€”especially in healthcare and I enjoy working at the intersection of technology, data, and design.

At Roche Diabetes Care, I started as a UX researcher and grew into product leadership roles, now driving innovation for next-generation continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) solutions. My work involves identifying unmet needs through user research, translating insights into product strategy, and working cross-functionally with design, engineering, regulatory, and medical teams to bring ideas to life. Iâ€™ve led research across five countries, built personas, created standardized research processes, and developed go-to-market strategies grounded in both evidence and empathy.

I studied Computer Science at Purdue University, and I still love building on the side. Whether I'm coding personal projects, sketching out product ideas, or diving into quantitative UX methods, I stay energized by learning and creating. When Iâ€™m not working, I spend time running, hiking, snowboarding, and reading.
