Hi, I'm Braden Buchanan 👋

Hi, I'm a Senior Product Manager at Roche Diagnostics, leading next-generation continuous glucose monitoring.

I led the market research and launch strategy for Roche's first [AI-powered CGM](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-07-09) in Europe. I also wrote a book on [Jobs-to-be-Done](https://odi-jtbd-book-public.vercel.app/book/00-introduction) research and Outcome Driven Innovation.

I see myself as a generalist focused on Product Management, UX Research, and technical problem-solving, since solving the right problems requires a deep understanding of users, strategy, and execution.
